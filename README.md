🧾 Project Title:
Fraud Detection & Pattern Analysis in Bank Transactions

📍 Business Problem:
The bank faced increasing fraudulent transactions, with no effective visibility into when or where these occur. Manual review overwhelmed the fraud team, and most alerts were false positives. The business needed data-driven insights to proactively detect suspicious activity and improve operational efficiency.

🎯 Objectives:
Goal	Outcome
Identify high-risk transactions	SQL & Excel logic for fraud scoring
Analyze fraud behavior by time & amount	Hourly and amount-based risk trends
Reduce alert fatigue	Prioritized high-risk transactions
Build a dashboard	Power BI with fraud KPIs and slicers
Document everything as a BA	BRD, stakeholder map, AS-IS / TO-BE, user stories

🧰 Tools Used:
Tool	Purpose
Excel	Cleaning and enrichment (Hour, Amount Bucket)
SQL Server	Fraud segmentation queries
Power BI	Dashboard and fraud pattern visuals
Lucidchart / Draw.io	Process maps (AS-IS / TO-BE)
Word	BRD, Stakeholder Analysis

📊 Key Insights:
Insight	Why it Matters
🕒 Most frauds occur in early morning hours (1–4 AM)	Indicates potential bot or scripted attacks
💵 High-value transactions (> ₹1000) had 3× higher fraud rate	Suggests need for limits and additional checks
⚠️ Overall fraud rate is 0.17%	Though rare, losses are significant
📉 90%+ of flagged transactions were false positives in current model	Creates inefficiency for Fraud Ops team

💡 Recommendations:
✅ Enable dynamic transaction scoring by time, amount, and device

✅ Block high-value transactions from new IPs at high-risk hours

✅ Add machine learning models in the future for pattern detection

✅ Automate alerts and build real-time dashboards

"I conducted a fraud pattern analysis project using anonymized banking data. I cleaned the data in Excel, wrote SQL queries to identify peak fraud hours and high-risk transaction types, and built a Power BI dashboard showing real-time alerts and fraud KPIs. I also documented the project from a business analyst's perspective including BRD, stakeholder mapping, and process redesign."
